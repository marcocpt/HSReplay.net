	Queue all raw logs to attempt processing them into UploadEvents.

	The primary use for this is for when we deploy code. The intended deploy process is:
		- Notify S3 to suspend triggering lambda upon log upload
		- Perform the Deploy
		- Notify S3 to resume triggering lambda upon log upload
		- Invoke this function to queue for processing any logs uploaded during the deploy

	This method is not intended to requeue uploads that have previously failed.
	For that see the requeue_failed_* family of methods.
