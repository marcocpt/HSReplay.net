"""
A management command for training classifiers intended to be run on a period interval.

Whenever this command is run it will dynamically determine how long it's been since the
previous classifier was trained. It will then determine the correct lookback window
such that the classifier trained during this invocation is exposed to --percent_new %
of new decks.
